## My_ls
For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, my_ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand that names a file of type directory, my_ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.
If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed. If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

## My_printf
The my_printf() function produce output according to a format as described below. The my_printf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream.
This function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

## My_tar
my_tar is a command to manipulate tape archive. The first option to tar is a mode indicator from the following:
* -c Create a new archive containing the specified items.
* -r Like -c, but new entries are appended to the archive. The -f option is required.
* -t List archive contents to stdout.
* -u Like -r, but new entries are added only if they have a modification date newer than the corresponding entry in the archive. The -f option is required.
* -x Extract to disk from the archive. If a file with the same name appears more than once in the archive, each copy will be extracted, with later copies overwriting (replacing) earlier copies.
